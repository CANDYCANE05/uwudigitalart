<h1>digital art. <spano</span></h1><br>
<h2>Most digital art programs function similarly,</h2></h2>
<p>They almost always have brushes, canvas size control, and selection tools among other things. Digital art can
be a very versatile tool if used correctly. It can be difficult to get used to it, but all the frustration is worth it in the end! You can create many different styles of art including but not limited to: painting¸ animation, line illustrations, etc. digital art has raised in popularity in the recent years. The tools that are mainly used in digital art include: a laptop or pc computer, art tablet or ipad, and your imagination</p. 

<br>


<p>Some tools are different in art programs than in real life. That can be confusing for the beginning digital artist.
Some like the stabilizer tool are used so that the lineart looks smoother and more refined. When digital art was first
starting to get popular, some artists thought that the stabilizer tool did all the work for you. That is not the case!
If you have tried digital art before, this becomes apparent fast. Other tools that are different from real life are all
the selection tools. The selection tool helps by taking the lineart or other part of your drawing and it lets you
move it anywhere on the canvas! It’s a lifesaver when you make a perfect line but it’s in the wrong place. The flip
tool is also useful so you can see if your drawing is balanced. Digital art is a fast growing medium. With so many
artists using it there’s no wonder it’s so mainstream! Another feature on many programs is the ability to get a video
speedpaint of your creation!</p>

This drawing is one of my recent ones. As you can see the lines are pretty smooth, the shading is soft, and it’s a pretty clean looking piece. The background is quite simple. This drawing took me about an hour! Digital art may take longer than traditional art, but the end result is worth it.<br>I hope you enjoy this page!</p>
